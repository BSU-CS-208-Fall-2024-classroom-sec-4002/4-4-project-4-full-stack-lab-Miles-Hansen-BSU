## Experience

During this experience, I thought that I was able to learn a lot about how this project and how I would need to attach my SQL files to my user files. It took me some time to apply what I had learned from the Zybooks to be able to figure out how everything worked. I had to adapt some of the source code to be able to fit what I needed, and I also had to go to the docs of the extensions we were using to be able to complete the assignment. When I set up the pug file, I was mostly aiming for a simple, but functional file. 

I felt like I was easily able to understand the assignment, but taking the assignment from where I was to being able to get the code I was running working was the hard part for me. I thought that being able to access the database and figuring out how to attach that was the hardest part for me, as I didn't have very much experience doing that in the past. Once I knew how to get all of the parts together, it went very smoothly. Learning how to adapt the pug and javascript files together was an interesting project.
